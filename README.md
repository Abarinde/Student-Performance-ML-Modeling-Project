# Student-Performance-ML-Modeling-Project
The project objective is to build and optimize a Machine Learning Classification Model. The classification models handle feature engineering challenges, and demonstrate the impact of hyperparameter tuning.
# Project Objectives
1. Prepare data for machine learning models (indentify and justify choice of target variable).
2. Apply appropriate feature scaling and encoding techniques (one hot encoding, Label encoding, Target encoding and Binary encoding).
3. Select appropriate machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, Random forest classifier, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine and K-nearest neighbors)
4. Evaluate model performance using proper metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, & classification report)
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning and compare results (Grid search CV)
6. Perform cross-validation using k-fold 5
7. Present Machine Learning findings
